<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to Holtz!<br>
With Holtz, you can play the abstract strategy games <a href="zertz.php">Z&egrave;rtz</a> and <a href="dvonn.php">Dvonn</a>. 
Both of them are board games&nbsp;invented by Kris Burm, and are part of the <a href="http://www.gipf.com">GIPF project</a>.
Recently a third game called <a href="relax.php">Relax</a> was added. It is based on the board game &quot;Take it easy&quot; and can be played 
alone as well as with up to ten players.

<h2>Z&egrave;rtz:: The Game</h2>

Z&egrave;rtz is a board game similar sophisticated than chess. 
It is played by two players.
The players alternatingly set or knock out pieces <a href="zertz.php">according 
to several rules</a> and have to 
gain a certain amount of white, grey or black pieces to win.


<h2>Dvonn:: The Game</h2>

In Dvonn, the players form stacks <a href="dvonn.php">according to several rules</a>
to capture the opponent's pieces without losing connection to the
special DVONN pieces. The higher the stack, the faster it moves, so the
tension increases until the very end...

<h2>Relax:: The Game</h2>

Relax is based on the game &quot;Take it easy&quot; and can be
played alone as well as with up to 10 players. Pieces with color coded
numbers are drawn at random and have to be placed on the board in a
way that leads to the <a href="relax.php">highest possible score</a>. You can be sure, that things don't 
always work out as you wish...
