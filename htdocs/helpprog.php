<h2>Playing Holtz locally</h2>
Holtz can be played locally against human or (more likely) computer players. 
Holtz is easy to learn, because there are lots of hints for beginners: the
status bar always tells you what to do now, or you can optionally show the
possible moves. You can even have the computer suggest a move for you. <br>

<h2>Skins</h2>
The graphics for board and stones can be easily exchanged using skin files (even 
while the game is running).
Currently, the skins are mainly used to support different screen resolutions,
but you can easily create a different design using every graphics program. (We are
always interested in contributed skins.)<br> 
By the way, the computer's moves are automatically animated, so that it's easier
to see what he's doing.

<h2>Playing Holtz over a network</h2>
Want to play Holtz with friends living elsewhere? No problem, network playing
is an important part of Holtz. Simply connect to your friend's computer using
any TCP/IP-based network (e.g. the Internet) and play together. By the way, Holtz 
is not limited to the traditional 'one-player-per-computer' mode. You can 
run several players (e.g. AI players) on one computer in networked mode, too, 
and you can even connect to a game without participating yourself - e.g. to learn
from your friends, or give them advice. Of course, the server player (the one who
started the game) can always throw unwanted watchers out of the game.
