* BUGS: 

- cleaning up left-over players when starting new game (potential crashes)
- figure out potential problems with line_net code on the stack while
  processing modal game setup dialog
- failed network connection attempts are not reported nicely for client
- player names on new game can be bogus for client
- connection dialog on server can not be used during wizard execution 
   (consider creating own non-modal wizard)

- think about good way to handle finished games loaded as pbm file
- for any reason reading skin.ini files with 2 underscores in one name crashes...
- why segfault on exit with wxWidgets 2.8?

* Features:

- better AI (looking for sente moves first, rate situations better)
- save settings, last ruleset
- save game, load game
- fully customize board 
- customize AI
- connect dialog resizable
- show ready status in connect dialog
- show ready status, ai status and help mode for each player
- show moves played (position tree)
- show moves review 

- for full bgp 1.00a master support: 
 * implement move reminder
 * implement board transmition as alternative to setup+moves
 (I will implement this if someone wants to develop his own bgp 1.00a
 client which is facilitated by just dealing with boards - please
