* BUGS: 

- client name/ip not valid for server in linux
- asking queries should be deferred during game setup dialog
- fix memory leak in ai.cpp -> AI_Input::destroy_ai

* Features:

- nicer variant tree
  * allow removing subtrees
  * allow analysis mode in network connections to make trial moves
- think about good way to handle finished games 
  * allow undo / new-game for both players: extra state for finished games?
- enable to reopen connection dialog (for server) when dialog was closed
- disallow client to keep connection in setup dialog when connection was closed
- better AI 
- save settings, last ruleset
- save game, load game
- fully customize board 
- customize AI
- connections dialog resizable
- show ready status in connections dialog
- show ready status, ai status and help mode for each player in player list
- show moves review 
- show winning requirements after game started

- for full bgp 1.00a master support: 
 * implement move reminder
 * implement board transmition as alternative to setup+moves
 (I will implement this feature if someone wants to develop his own
 bgp 1.00a client which is facilitated by just dealing with boards - please
 contact: windiana@users.sourceforge.net)

-- current branch TODOs:
- improve bloks-AI: rate convex player area starting from start corner: fields occupied, corners available for placing stones, corners available for placing stones that can not be blocked by a single move of each opponent (opposite team/paranoid assumption)
