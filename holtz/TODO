* BUGS: 

- Client name/ip not valid for server in linux

- asking queries should be deferred during game setup dialog
- why segfault on exit with wxWidgets 2.8 under linux?

- DVONN AI considers some positions falsely as win

* Features:

- think about good way to handle finished games 
  * allow undo / new-game for both players: extra state for finished games?

- disallow client to keep connection in setup dialog when connection was closed

- better AI 
- save settings, last ruleset
- save game, load game
- fully customize board 
- customize AI
- connections dialog resizable
- show ready status in connections dialog
- show ready status, ai status and help mode for each player in player list
- show moves played (position tree) / allow jump to old position (in other branch)
- allow analysis mode in network connections to make trial moves
- show moves review 
- show winning requirements

- for full bgp 1.00a master support: 
 * implement move reminder
 * implement board transmition as alternative to setup+moves
 (I will implement this feature if someone wants to develop his own
 bgp 1.00a client which is facilitated by just dealing with boards - please
 contact: windiana@users.sourceforge.net)
