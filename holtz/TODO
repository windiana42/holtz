* BUGS: 

- think about good way to handle finished games 
  * allow undo / new-game for both players: extra state for finished games?
- asking queries should be deferred during game setup dialog
- why segfault on exit with wxWidgets 2.8 under linux?

* Features:

- disallow client to keep connection in setup dialog when connection was closed

- better AI (looking for sente moves first, rate situations better)
- save settings, last ruleset
- save game, load game
- fully customize board 
- customize AI
- connect dialog resizable
- show ready status in connect dialog
- show ready status, ai status and help mode for each player
- show moves played (position tree)
- show moves review 
- show winning requirements

- for full bgp 1.00a master support: 
 * implement move reminder
 * implement board transmition as alternative to setup+moves
 (I will implement this if someone wants to develop his own bgp 1.00a
 client which is facilitated by just dealing with boards - please
