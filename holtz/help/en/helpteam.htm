<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>First of all, we'd like to congratulate <a href="http://www.gipf.com/project_gipf/burm/burm.html">Kris Burm</a>, 
the inventor of Z&egrave;rtz and Dvonn, on his games, which we enjoy a lot. 
<p>Big thanks go to the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> developers. The wxWidgets library makes it easy to write cross-platform programs, and provides the GUI, network and multi-threading classes which are used in Holtz.
<p>Thanks also to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> team, who provide great developer services.
